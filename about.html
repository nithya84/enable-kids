                <p>Hi! I'm Nithya Krishnamoorthy. I have spent 25 years working with kids who don't fit standard educational models and 10 years building infrastructure at Google. I'm an aunt to a child on the autism spectrum, and for the past several years I've been providing educational and behavioral support.</p>

        <h2>What I've seen</h2>

        <p>The system is failing these families. Through my intensive work with one child and my many conversations with dozens of families with kids on the spectrum - especially those who aren't classified medically as having high needs - I keep seeing the same things.</p>

        <p>The parents are exhausted. By the end of each day on what feels like a battleground, they don't have much left to give. They get generic advice from professionals who don't care enough to understand their specific child. Cookie cutter advice that hasn't worked once for their child. Most suggestions feel like they were designed for someone else's kid.</p>

        <p>And many of these children are struggling with crippling anxiety that we adults often misread as defiance, inability, or lack of motivation. A child who can't get ready for school isn't being difficult - they might be paralyzed by the fear of forgetting something, or overwhelmed by too many decisions, or unable to transition between activities without specific structure. But from the outside, it just looks like they're not trying.</p>

        <p>And then there's the fact that every child on the spectrum is completely different. What works brilliantly for one child fails entirely for another. The behavioral strategies that help one kid manage meltdowns might trigger worse reactions in another. The learning approaches that engage one child leave another completely shut down. There's no template, no standard protocol that works across the board.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <p>When the child I work with was in 4th grade, the school said he didn't know how to compare numbers. I asked him over dinner: if he had 10 cookies and could give me either 4 or 6, which would he choose? He chose 4 - the smaller number. I tried this in several scenarios. He picked the smaller number every single time. He didn't guess. He knew exactly which number was smaller because he wanted to keep more cookies for himself.</p>

        <p>But when I asked him directly, "Is 4 greater than 6?" he would take a random guess.</p>

        <p>What the school interpreted as "doesn't know how to compare numbers" was actually "absolutely could not care less about an abstract question that means nothing to him." The knowledge was there. The ability was there. But without something that mattered to him, he couldn't access what he knew.</p>

        <p>A different kind of problem: mornings were a disaster. He would rush around looking for things, always running late. One day he almost got into an accident running across the road. That was the crisis point.</p>

        <p>I started by getting him to envision what he actually wanted - peaceful mornings where he had time to get ready without panic. Then we worked backwards: fixed his sleep schedule (teens need more sleep than they think), created a visual checklist for his morning routine, addressed hidden anxieties like a simple shower checklist that eliminated his fear of missing body parts while washing.</p>

        <p>It took about 2-3 weeks, but mornings became peaceful. He's mostly never late now. His parents stopped starting every day drained and frustrated. He stopped running out the door in a panic.</p>

        <p>What I learned: standard approaches miss what's actually happening. With the math, I needed to find relevance - cookies he wanted, not abstract numbers. With mornings, I needed to address the cascading anxiety, not lecture him about time management. When you understand what's really blocking a child and meet them where they actually are, change becomes possible. But it takes trying multiple approaches, understanding each child's specific needs, and having the patience to work through what's really going on.</p>

        <h2>Why AI changes everything</h2>

        <p>Here's what made me start building enable.kids: capitalism optimizes for scale. Companies can't justify building specialized tools for small populations when development costs are high and the market is limited. The numbers never made sense unless products were exorbitantly priced.</p>

        <p>But AI is changing that equation completely. It's dramatically cheaper to build software now. Suddenly, highly personalized tools for very specific needs - even for tiny population subsets - become viable. This is the moment when tools for neurodivergent children can finally exist without requiring massive venture capital or philanthropic funding.</p>

        <p>Right as the pandemic hit in 2020, I had just left Google. I founded <a href="https://dialtoteach.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Dial To Teach</a>, connecting 70+ volunteer educators with students in India who suddenly had no access to school or smartphones. The program was hugely successful during the pandemic, but I wound it down because of how resource intensive it got.</p>

        <p>Now, for the first time, I can build the personalized tools I've known these families need - tools that adapt to individual children, that meet kids where their interests are, that support parents dealing with challenges that don't fit any textbook.</p>

        <h2>What I'm building</h2>

        <p>I'm committing the next three months to building and shipping tools for neurodivergent children and their families. The memory game is just the beginning. I'm working on sharing the structured behavioral support tools that I've already developed, resources for parents dealing with burnout and non-textbook challenges, and whatever else emerges as genuinely useful.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to build a startup. I'm not trying to scale to millions of users or raise funding. I'm building practical tools based on what I've learned actually works, making them accessible and affordable. If even a handful of families find relief from what I build, that's meaningful work.</p>
