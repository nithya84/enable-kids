            <div class="profile-text">
                <p>Hi! I'm Nithya Krishnamoorthy. I've spent 25 years working with kids who don't fit standard educational models and 10 years building infrastructure at Google. I'm an aunt to a child on the autism spectrum, and for the past several years I've been providing educational and behavioral support.</p>
                <p>My work has always been with kids the system tells to "work harder" - first with kids trapped in poverty, spending all their energy on basic survival, then told they should have worked harder in school if they wanted to deserve better in life. Now I work closely with a neurodivergent child who spends all his energy just coping in a world built against how his brain works, trying to understand communication patterns that aren't meant for him.</p>
                <p>The specifics are different, but the pattern is the same. When standard approaches don't work, the system blames the child instead of questioning whether the approach was ever designed for them.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>What I've seen</h2>

        <p>The system is failing these families. Through my intensive work with one child and my many conversations with dozens of families with kids on the spectrum - especially those who aren't classified medically as having high needs - I keep seeing the same things.</p>

        <p>The parents are exhausted. By the end of each day on what feels like a battleground, they don't have much left to give. They get generic advice from professionals who don't care enough to understand their specific child. Cookie cutter advice that hasn't worked once for their child. Most suggestions feel like they were designed for someone else's kid.</p>

        <p>And many of these children are struggling with crippling anxiety that we adults often misread as defiance, inability, or lack of motivation. A child who can't get ready for school isn't being difficult - they might be paralyzed by the fear of forgetting something, or overwhelmed by too many decisions, or unable to transition between activities without specific structure. But from the outside, it just looks like they're not trying.</p>

        <p>And then there's the fact that every child on the spectrum is completely different. What works brilliantly for one child fails entirely for another. The behavioral strategies that help one kid manage meltdowns might trigger worse reactions in another. The learning approaches that engage one child leave another completely shut down. There's no template, no standard protocol that works across the board.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <p>When the child I work with was in 4th grade, the school said he didn't know how to compare numbers. I asked him over dinner: if he had 10 cookies and could give me either 4 or 6, which would he choose? He chose 4 - the smaller number. I plugged in other numbers. He picked the smaller number every single time. He didn't guess. He knew exactly which number was smaller because he wanted to keep more cookies for himself.</p>

        <p>But when I asked him directly, "Is 4 greater than 6?" he would take a random guess.</p>

        <p>What the school interpreted as "doesn't know how to compare numbers" was actually "absolutely could not care less about an abstract question that means nothing to him." The knowledge was there. The ability was there. But without something that mattered to him, he simply couldn't access what he knew.</p>

        <p>The usual motivators that work for neurotypical kids - authority, social pressure, future consequences, pleasing the teacher - mean nothing to many kids on the spectrum. They need a reason that matters to them, right now, in concrete terms they can connect to.</p>

        <p>This shows up everywhere. A parent I know asked me recently for help with her child leaving the house on time. Not just remembering items, but the whole sequence - estimating time, organizing tasks, getting out the door when needed. What comes naturally to some of us is genuinely alien for these kids. It's not laziness. It's overwhelming. They feel out of control, overstimulated, and they shut down. Pressure and frustration only make it worse.</p>

        <p>So what actually works?</p>

        <p><strong>Buy-in through concrete understanding.</strong> Abstract instructions don't land. "We need to leave on time" means nothing. But walking through exactly why we need to leave at 8:15 to arrive by 9:00 - making the time visible and real - that can work. When I need to explain why something impossible can't happen, I make it tangible: "That's like me wanting the sun to rise right now when it's still night. Can I make that happen?" It's not me saying no. It's about understanding how things actually work.</p>

        <p><strong>Externalizing the mental overwhelm.</strong> When everything feels like it's happening at once, the brain can't sort it. Anxious thoughts, task sequences, time pressure - it all piles up. Give these things external structure: a "later box" for thoughts that need to wait, visual checklists that break down steps, timers that make time concrete instead of abstract. It's not about suppressing the overwhelm - it's about organizing it into something manageable.</p>

        <p><strong>Meeting the underlying need.</strong> Behaviors that look problematic are usually serving a function. I learned this with my own skin-picking - once I understood it was soothing behavior, I substituted gently rubbing my hand with self-compassion. If a child is dawdling before leaving, maybe transition itself is hard and they need a different kind of support - not just pressure to move faster. The memory game on this site works the same way: instead of fighting against special interests, it uses them as the fuel for engagement and learning.</p>

        <p><strong>Scaffolding toward independence.</strong> Every support should be teaching the skill, not just managing the child. If you're always the one calling out each step, organizing their thoughts, pushing them through transitions, they're not learning to do it themselves. The goal is to build supports that fade - visual guides they eventually internalize, strategies they learn to apply on their own.</p>

        <p><strong>Knowing your limits.</strong> Sometimes even the best strategies aren't enough - the anxiety or dysregulation runs too deep. Recognizing when you need professional support, when behavioral approaches have hit their ceiling, is part of the journey too.</p>

        <h2>What I'm building</h2>

        <p>I'm building tools based on these principles - starting with a memory game that uses special interests to make learning engaging, with more to come. I'm also sharing frameworks and first-person stories that have worked. These help bridge something that doesn't happen automatically for many neurodivergent kids: the translation between understanding something in theory and knowing what to actually do in the moment.</p>

        <p>Every tool, every resource is an experiment in what happens when we design for neurodivergent brains from the start, not as an afterthought.</p>

        <p>There are so many kids who could thrive with the right supports, and so many caregivers doing hard, important work without enough resources. I'm excited to build things that might help. If this approach resonates with you, I'd love for you to try what's here and let me know what would be useful next.</p>
